# Codex Task Prefix

Copy/paste this prefix at the top of each Codex task:

```
Task setup:
1) Read docs/_index/AI_INDEX.md and note impacted sections.
2) If any manifest triggers are hit, update docs/_index/AI_INDEX.md and the relevant docs/01_specs/* sources of truth.
3) Keep changes scoped; no broad refactors or new protocol fields without specs.
4) In the final response, list changed files and summarize contract impacts.
```
